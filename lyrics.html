You can throw it all away,

When things break, things shatter.

Keep it written on your face, the little details matter.

Only in me, I am the coil, I am the spring.

Only in me, I am the ghost in the machine.

Only in me, recount confession give no release.

Only in me, will your stain even live to be.

Die for me brother, know not what you’ve seen.

Love one another, know not where you’ve been.

Lie for me brother, know not what you’ve said.

Use me for cover.

When things break, things shatter.

Just a sliver of a thought can make even a thick head clatter,

Disappear without a trace, while the whole world’s laughing,

But it’s only in me.
